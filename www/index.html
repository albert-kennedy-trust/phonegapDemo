    <h2>How we can help</h2>
    <h4>Our priority is your safety. When we can’t help you to stay safely at home, we may be able to offer you help with a safe and supportive place to stay.</h4>

	<h3>Safe Homes</h3>
	<p>Our Purple Door project has a mix of emergency, medium and long term accommodation in London, Manchester and Newcastle.</p>
	
	<p>This includes our Independent Living project in Newcastle and Northumberland which offers a mix of self-contained flats and bedsits for up to 18	months.</p>

	<p>Our Supported Lodgings project has a network of volunteer carers in London and Manchester who can provide a room in a safe home and family environment.</p>

	<p> AKT also works with housing providers in London, Manchester & Newcastle who may also be able to meet your need for safe housing. Throughout your stay with AKT we will help you get your life back on track and move on.</p>

    <h4>Emergency Support</h4>
<p>When forced into a period of homelessness there
are often more issues than just finding somewhere
to live. AKT could help you with practical and
financial support to stay off the streets and to
maintain positive networks and routines.

<h4>Rainbow Starter Pack</h4>
<p>Living on your own is tough! We may be able to support you with moving onto independent living by helping reduce the cost of living in your own place.
<h2>Other services</h2>
<p>Our support doesn’t end when you find somewhere to live. We will continue to work with you both at our offices and elsewhere to help you make
the right choices for you and to ensure that
homelessness is a thing of the past - not the future.</p>

        <p>If you feel frustrated or unable to talk to people in
authority when asking for help, AKT may be able
to help you get the support and services you are
entitled to.
<p>Our team of staff and volunteer advocates know
how to get the best for you. If you are unhappy with
how you are being treated they will write letters of
support, come with you to meetings, talk to decision
makers and can explain your rights to make sure
they aren’t ignored.

	<h2>People like me</h2>
	
	<p>"With AKT I lived with a lesbian
who was my carer. I lived in her house
and got my own room. It was the first time
that I felt comfortable being
a lesbian and I didn’t have to hide
the person I am."

<p>"I had threats of violence from relatives who
see my sexuality as a cause of
family shame. Despite all I have been
through, I am proud to say I am
making good progress."

<p>"Right now I’ve got my own place and I’m
retaking my GCSEs. Without the help from
The Albert Kennedy Trust I don’t
think that would have been possible."
